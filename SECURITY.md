## Reporting a Vulnerability

**GitHub Repository Security Vulnerability Reporting Policy**

**1. Introduction:**

This document outlines the procedure for reporting security vulnerabilities found within the GitHub repository associated with MindSQL. We take security vulnerabilities seriously and encourage responsible disclosure to ensure the integrity and security of our project.

**2. Reporting Process:**

2.1. **Responsible Disclosure:**
   - We encourage security researchers, collaborators, and users to responsibly disclose any security vulnerabilities they discover in our project.
   - Vulnerabilities should be reported promptly and privately to samarpatel.mi@gmail.com, allowing us to assess and address the issue before it is publicly disclosed.

2.2. **Information to Include:**
   - When reporting a security vulnerability, please provide detailed information to help us understand and reproduce the issue. This may include:
     - Description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce
     - Affected versions
     - Impact and potential exploit scenarios
     - Any additional context or mitigating factors

2.3. **Confidentiality:**
   - We respect the privacy and security of individuals reporting vulnerabilities and will handle all reports with confidentiality.
   - Vulnerability reports should not be shared publicly until an appropriate fix has been implemented and released.

**3. Response and Resolution:**

3.1. **Acknowledgment:**
   - Upon receiving a vulnerability report, we will acknowledge receipt within a week.
   - We appreciate the effort and responsible behavior of those reporting vulnerabilities and will keep them informed throughout the resolution process.

3.2. **Assessment and Validation:**
   - Our team will promptly assess and validate the reported vulnerability to determine its severity and impact on the project.
   - We may request additional information or clarification from the reporter if needed to fully understand the issue.

3.3. **Mitigation and Fix:**
   - Once validated, we will work diligently to develop and implement an appropriate fix for the vulnerability.
   - Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, we may release a patch, update, or workaround to address the issue.

**4. Public Disclosure:**

4.1. **Coordination:**
   - We aim to coordinate the public disclosure of security vulnerabilities to ensure that users have access to relevant information and mitigation measures.
   - Public disclosure will be coordinated with the reporter to ensure that it aligns with their preferences and any responsible disclosure agreements.

4.2. **Timing:**
   - We will aim to disclose security vulnerabilities publicly only after an appropriate fix has been implemented and released to minimize the risk of exploitation.

**5. Legal and Ethical Considerations:**

5.1. **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA):**
   - If requested, we are open to signing a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with reporters to protect sensitive information exchanged during the vulnerability disclosure process.

5.2. **Legal Protections:**
   - We are committed to complying with applicable laws and regulations governing the reporting and handling of security vulnerabilities, including protections for security researchers.

**6. Conclusion:**

By following this security vulnerability reporting policy, we aim to foster a collaborative and transparent approach to addressing security issues within our project. We appreciate the cooperation of security researchers, collaborators, and users in helping us maintain the security and integrity of our GitHub repository.
